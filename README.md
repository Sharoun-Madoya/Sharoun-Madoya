“Hello! I’m Mary, and I am a front-end developer at XYZ working extensively on mobile applications. After majoring in computer science, I worked for a small start-up as a software developer and soon found myself specializing in front-end software development. I am willing to expand my horizons to projects looking for software support and consultancy, especially security firms.”

“Hi! I’m a Senior Java Developer with ten years of experience working in mobile banking infrastructure, which everyone has come to know and utilize, especially in online trading. I recently wrapped up my contract at XYZ, and I was overly excited when I learned about this opportunity opening at your company. I’m looking to accelerate my career in this line of work, hoping to lead my team of developers.”
