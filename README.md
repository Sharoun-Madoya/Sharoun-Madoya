“Hello! I just wanted to let you know How much I love front-end developing. I am currently working on JavaScript and React as my framework to create simple easy-to-use beautiful web apps. After majoring in Electrical Instrumentation engineering, I worked for a small start-up as a software developer and soon found myself specializing in front-end software development. I am willing to expand my horizons to projects looking for software support in the Tech industry.”
